## 🎯 Why I Need Support

I’m building [SensingSkill.com](https://www.sensingskill.com) from Bamako, Mali — a multilingual, AI-enhanced knowledge platform to help people in second-, third-, and first-world countries access and apply best practices in all art forms and science fields.

This site — MamadouLamineKaba.com — is where I document the journey and keep things transparent.
