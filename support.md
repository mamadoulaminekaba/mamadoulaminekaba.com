# 🤝 Support My Journey

Thank you for considering supporting my mission to build inclusive educational tools, create long-term infrastructure for digital learning, and make knowledge more accessible worldwide.

## 🎯 Why I Need Support

I’m building **SensingSkill.com** from **Bamako, Mali** — a multilingual, AI-powered knowledge platform that helps people from all backgrounds access and apply best practices in **every art form and scientific field**.

This site — **mamadoulaminekaba.com** — documents my academic, personal, and professional journey. Your support directly empowers me to sustain my responsibilities and development goals.

## ⏳ Immediate Needs (Now through September 2025)

From now until September, I’m asking for **personal support** from those closest to me — family, friends, and trusted contacts — to help me:

- Replace my aging 2013 MacBook Pro with a high-performance Mac
- Maintain reliable mobile internet access and field presentation capabilities
- Subscribe to essential software tools (AI services, hosting, design tools)
- Cover transportation and daily development-related costs
- Maintain academic momentum while building out the foundation of SensingSkill.com

## 🌱 Project Support (Fall 2025 Onward)

Starting in **September 2025**, I will receive my next round of academic funding to cover core living and educational needs. After that point, all additional support will be directed toward building **SensingSkill.com**, including:

- Access to high-performance Windows laptops and Android phones for cross-platform testing
- Advanced SaaS tools to expand and automate development
- Educational content generation, validation, and translation
- Integration with local businesses and affiliate ecosystems
