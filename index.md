**Digital Humanist | LIS Graduate Student | Founder of SensingSkill.com**

Welcome to my official personal site. I'm currently completing my Master’s in Library and Information Science at Long Island University while living and working in Bamako, Mali. This site documents my academic journey, outlines my future plans, and shares the origin and vision behind the platform I'm building: **SensingSkill.com**.

## 🎓 Academic & Professional Path

I am pursuing a long-term academic path that bridges digital preservation, AI, and global learning equity:

- **2024–2026:** MSLIS (Master of Science in Library & Information Science)
- **2026–2029:** PhD in Information Studies (planned)
- Focus areas: digital preservation, metadata, AI for knowledge access

During this time, I’m building and refining SensingSkill.com as my Master’s Project, PhD pilot, and long-term knowledge platform for second-, third-, and first-world learners.
