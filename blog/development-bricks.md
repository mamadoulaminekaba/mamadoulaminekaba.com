# 🧱 What’s a Development Brick?

SensingSkill.com is my contribution to making world-class skill learning accessible to people in second-, third-, and first-world environments.

To build it responsibly, I’ve structured a community-driven support model where each donor — regardless of budget — can meaningfully participate.

## 💡 Introducing Development Bricks

Each donation is more than just a transaction — it’s a piece of the foundation.

| Tier               | Cost      | What It Builds |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **🧱 Brick**        | $10       | One session of internet, AI tools, or printed materials |
| **🧱🧱🧱 Row of Bricks** | $50   | A week of tool access + focused development sessions |
| **🧱🔧 Foundation Block** | $100+ | Hardware upgrades and licensing for content platforms |
| **🏛️ Cornerstone** | $500+     | Field testing, MVP outreach, mobility for deployment |

## 🛠️ Why It Works

This model:
- Keeps donations inclusive and modular
- Aligns support with real-world development needs
- Lets you choose your level of impact

## 🤝 Join the Build Crew

I’m currently coding and testing the platform from Bamako, Mali. Your brick directly supports progress on:

- Multilingual content generation
- AI workflow automation
- Cross-platform testing (Mac, Windows, Android, Web)
- MVP outreach in second- and third-world communities
